# <p align="center"> Highlight Reel: Automated Sports Content Generation </p>

## <p align="center"> Project Description: </p>

In the fast-paced world of sports streaming, automated highlight generation is becoming increasingly crucial for engaging fans and providing quick insights. In this Build Project, you'll step into the role of a Machine Learning Engineer to develop an end-to-end system for automated sports action recognition and highlight generation. You will develop a fully functional automated sports highlight generation system, including a trained action classification model, a video processing pipeline, and a highlight generation algorithm.

Under the guidance of an experienced industry expert, you'll build machine learning models to classify player actions from tracking data, create a video processing pipeline, and implement highlight generation algorithms. You'll gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge technologies like computer vision, deep learning, and large language models, simulating the workflow of a real data science team in the sports tech industry.
