# <p align="center"> Highlight Reel: Automated Sports Content Generation </p>

## <p align="center"> Project Description: </p>

In the fast-paced world of sports streaming, automated highlight generation is becoming increasingly crucial for engaging fans and providing quick insights. In this Build Project, you'll step into the role of a Machine Learning Engineer to develop an end-to-end system for automated sports action recognition and highlight generation. You will develop a fully functional automated sports highlight generation system, including a trained action classification model, a video processing pipeline, and a highlight generation algorithm.

Under the guidance of an experienced industry expert, you'll build machine learning models to classify player actions from tracking data, create a video processing pipeline, and implement highlight generation algorithms. You'll gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge technologies like computer vision, deep learning, and large language models, simulating the workflow of a real data science team in the sports tech industry.

## <p align="center"> TODO: </p>

- [ ] Implement one of the discussed tracking data derived features:
  - Motion derivatives
  - Curvature
  - Distance traveled
  - Time in specific region
  - Sudden changes in direction
  - Distance profile
  - Proximity to key locations
  - Derived events
- [ ] Visualize the derived feature data with a graph/animation
- [ ] Outline why you chose the derived feature and how you think it correlates with what you're interest in extracting from the tracking data
